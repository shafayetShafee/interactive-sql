## HR sample data

Here we will use a sample Database called HR that manages the HR data of the small businesses which is collected from [www.sqltutorial.org](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/). And to create the database, a SQLite script file was used when rendering the document. Read the [extension docs](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/interactive-sql#using) for details.


## ERD of HR database

The following database diagram illustrates the HR sample database:

## Editable Example

And now, you can run all sort of queries from the tables of the HR databases.

```{.sql .interactive .hr}
select * from regions;
```


## Not editable example

You can also create "not-editable" code chunk (that is, you simply can run the query but won't be able to edit/modify it) for HR database. And to do this, just use another instance of database under the `database` key in the yaml with a different name and use the option `editable: false`.

## Not editable example

```{.sql .interactive .hr-not-editable}
select * from employees;
```
