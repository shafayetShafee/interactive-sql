<hr>

Here we will use a sample Database called HR that manages the HR data of the small businesses which is collected from [www.sqltutorial.org](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/). And to create the database, a SQLite script file was used when rendering the document. Read the [extension docs](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/interactive-sql#using) for details.

## HR sample database

The following database diagram illustrates the HR sample database:

![ERD of HR database](hr-SQL-Sample-Database-Schema.png){#fig-erd-hr}

And now, you can run all sort of queries from the tables of the HR databases.

## Editable Example

```{.sql .interactive .hr}
select * from regions;
```


## Not editable example

You can also create "not-editable" code chunk (that is, you simply can run the query but won't be able to edit/modify it) for HR database. And to do this, just use another instance of database under the `database` key in the yaml with a different name and use the option `editable: false`. Then all the code chunk with that name as class will be in not-editable mode. View the source code of this document by clicking `</> Code` on top-right corner, it will be more clear, what I am trying to say.


```{.sql .interactive .hr-not-editable}
select * from employees;
```
